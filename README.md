DSON is a Java library that helps you serialize/deserialize your objects to and from JSON. It is a highly efficient and error-safe library that is guaranteed to not make mistakes.

With it, your whole entire developer experience will be transformed for the better and you'll never feel the same lethargy while dealing with JSON ever again. DSON is like a breath of fresh air, simply call DSON.serialize() to serialize your object. It's as easy as one-two-three. Don't want something to be serialized? We've got you covered.
